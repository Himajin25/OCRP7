Features
AJAX interactions: answer to question submitted by user is displayed directly on the screen, without page reloading.
Mapbox API, Wikidata API and Wikipedia API are used along with Spacy to parse the user input.
Conversation history is lost upon page reload, nothing is saved.
Several different answers from GrandPy are coded

User experience
The user connects to the chatbot on this url from his preferred browser. 
The chat window is then divided from top to bottom into a header, a chatbox, an input field and a footer.
header: logo and catchphrase
chatbox: vertical chat room with text. Grandpy messages appear from top to bottom on the left side in green and user messages appear from top to bottom on the right side in red. 
input field bar and send button beneath 
footer: the developper first & last name, and a link to the project Github repository.
use: user types "Hi Grandpy! Do you know where the Eiffel Tower is?" in input field and presses Enter to submit his message. The message then appears beneath the last message in the chatbox. The screen then freezes and a loader appears while GrandPy's answer is being loaded.

GrandPy's replies then appear containing the address, general info about the location and a map with a marker.

Kanban of the project is given to see the roadmap.
